# Hooking By Example
A collection of example projects which demonstrate various hooking techniques.

At runtime, some projects may rely on other projects being built (injecting a dll requires that dll has been built), or running at the same time (hooking a target program requires it be already running).  

# Building
All examples were built using Visual Studio 2019 (v142) with Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0. 
I don't think there's anything here that's VS or SDK version dependent, but I'm listing it here just in case. There are almost certainly some things that are MSVC specific.
